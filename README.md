Official repository for CVPR 2023 paper: [WSSS via Adversarial Learning of Classifier and Reconstructor](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Kweon_Weakly_Supervised_Semantic_Segmentation_via_Adversarial_Learning_of_Classifier_and_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf)  by [Hyeokjun Kweon](https://github.com/sangrockEG) and [Sung-Hoon Yoon](https://github.com/sunghoonYoon).

# Prerequisite
* Tested on Ubuntu 18.04, with Python 3.8, PyTorch 1.8.2, CUDA 11.4, single gpu.
* You can create conda environment with the provided yaml file.
```
conda env create -f wsss_recon.yaml
```
* [The PASCAL VOC 2012 development kit](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/):
You need to specify place VOC2012 under ./data folder.
* ImageNet-pretrained weights for resnet38d are from [[resnet_38d.params]](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18TW8-SZcmsPEF8mmbGI5EG14rbh6EFYY?usp=drive_link) (From the google drive for our another paper, AEFT.)
You need to place the weights as ./pretrained/resnet_38d.params. **Note that we have reuploaded this file, as the file had been damaged.**

## Usage
> With the following code, you can generate CAMs (seeds) to train the segmentation network.
> For the further refinement, refer [RIB](https://github.com/jbeomlee93/RIB)

### Training
* Please specify the name of your experiment.
* Training results are saved at ./experiment/[exp_name]
```
python train_pl.py --name [exp_name] --exp recon_cvpr23
```
### Evaluation for CAM
```
python evaluation.py --name [exp_name] --task cam --dict_dir dict
```
* Pretrained weight (PASCAL, seed: 59.9% mIoU) can be downloaded [here]([https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ak7eAs8Y8ujjv8TKIp-qCW20fgiIWTc2?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18TW8-SZcmsPEF8mmbGI5EG14rbh6EFYY?usp=sharing)).
